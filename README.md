# Agentic Murder Mystery Game - Walkthrough

## Overview
A text-based murder mystery game where the story, map, and characters are generated by "Agents" (Writer, Location Scout, Casting Director).

## Features
- **Cinematic Loading Screen**: Visualizes the agents "creating" the production.
- **Agent Framework**: 
    - `Writer`: Generates the plot context.
    - `LocationScout`: Generates the mansion layout.
    - `CastingDirector`: Generates the suspect list.
    - `ExecutiveDirector`: Orchestrates the generation.
- **Text Engine**: Supports `look`, `north/south/east/west`, `talk <name>`.
- **Premium UI**: Terminal-style interface with glassmorphism and animations.

## How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory: `cd tbd`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install` (if not already done)
3. Start the dev server: `npm run dev`
4. Open the localhost URL.

## Usage
- **Navigation**: Type `north`, `south`, `east`, `west` to move between rooms.
- **Interaction**: Type `look` to inspect the room.
- **Conversation**: Type `talk <Name>` (e.g., `talk general`) to speak to a character.

## Verification
- Validated that `tsc` runs without errors.
- Verified directory structure and file placement.
- Confirmed "Agent" logic returns expected mocked JSON data.
